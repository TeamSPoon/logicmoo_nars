- • The world into which a human is born is complex. W

- discuss some of the complexities, concentrating on one—

- 3-d semi-permanent, movable objects.

- • Evolution has equipped a baby with some innate kno

- edge of the world. That works better than starting as

- blank slate.

- • Consider a well-designed logical robot child (WDC).

- Mostly it will have the innate abilities we conjecture real

- children have, but sometimes we can do better.

THE LOCKEAN BABY

- • John Locke 1693: The baby starts out as a blank slate.

- It builds its knowledge by inferring associations among

- stimuli.

- • Since 1950 people proposed to start with a Lockean

- blank slate baby machine and have it learn from its exp

- rience.

- • Starting from the blank slate, I’ll bet it’s a lengthy

- process to infer the existence of 3-d objects.

I don’t- think anyone has made an AI system that can do it.

- • A billion years of evolution has provided us with prett

- good prejudices about the world far better than a blank

- slate. Our robot child should also have them

THE WORLD IS COMPLICATED- • The world’s structure is not directly describable in terms

- of the input-output relations of a person. The basic struc-

- ture of the world involves elementary particles on time

- scales of 10−25 seconds, but intelligence only evolved

- structures of more than 1023 elementary particles.

- • Even at the level at which a small child can perceive

- the world is extremely complicated. Here are some of

- complications.

- • Reality and appearance Animals and humans don’t p

- ceive the structure of our environment directly. Senses

- have evolved to give partial

information about objects- and their relations.

- • The world is 3-d, but our senses react to surfaces.

MORE COMPLICATIONS

- • semi-permanent objects Much of the world consists

- three-dimensional objects that have masses, moments,

- compliances, hardnesses, chemical composition, shap

- outer surfaces with textures and colors, are often made

- identiﬁable parts which sometimes move relative to each

- other. A particular object can disappear from perception

- and reappear again.

- Note that the structure and location of an object in

- world are more persistent than its appearance and lo

- tion in the visual ﬁeld or relative to the hands.

- • temporal structure The environment of a child has

- complex temporal structure. Some items change in sec-

- onds, others last for hours, days, or years. Babies

- in the present. The concepts of tomorrow and yesterda

- are not learned right away.

- • causality Events cause changes in objects and their

- lations and cause other events.

STILL MORE COMPLICATIONS- • solidity Objects are solid and do not ordinarily penetrate

- one another. Some are rigid and some are ﬂexible.

- • gravity Unsupported objects fall to a lower surface.

- • kinds of objects Objects have kinds, and objects

- the same kind have properties associated with the kind.

- Babies are ready very early to learn what kinds there a

lemons, belong to natural kinds. The objects of- • natural kinds Many of the objects a child encounters,

- e.g.

- natural kind have yet undiscovered properties in common.

- Therefore, a natural kind is not deﬁnable by an if-and-

- only-if sentence formulated in terms of observables.

- • relations Objects not only have individual properties

- and belong to kinds, but objects and kinds have relations

- with one another. At least some ternary relations such

- as betweenness are basic. Also “A is to B as C is to

- seems to be basic.

In its numerical use, it reduces- the equality of two fractions, but the quaternary relation

- seems to be basic in common sense usage.

WHAT DO BABIES KNOW AND WHEN?- • Q: If the world is so complicated, how can babies

- anything purposeful?

- • A: They know simple cases of phenomena.

- • There’s good psychological evidence that they have

- innate knowledge of solid objects that continue existing

- even when out of sight. How do they remember an object

- that has gone out of sight so as to recognize it when

- reappears?

- • They are ready to ascribe purposeful action to humans

- and animals and to try to inﬂuence them.

- • the principle of mediocrity (from the astronomers) Our

- child is like other children. This lets it reason in b

- directions.

- • persons Some objects are animate and have purposes

- analogous to those of the child. They can be inﬂuenced

- but are sometimes to be feared. Defects in innate under-

- standing of persons, e.g. autism, harm the child.

WHAT DO WE WANT IN A WELL-DESIGNEDROBOT CHILD?

- • Distinguish appearance from reality

- • natural kinds Natural kinds don’t have if-and-only-if def-

- initions. There may always be more properties to

- learned. To a small child, all kinds are natural. The

- robot child should think in terms of natural kinds.

- • three-dimensional objects These are more stable than

- the perception of them by any sense.

- • perceive motion as continuous

- • actions and their eﬀects

- • recognize parts Recognize parts of an object and their

- relations to the others. It would be interesting to have

- grammar of 3-d physical structure analogous to that

- sentences.

- • focussed curiosity

- • grammar of goal regression To do A, I need to do

- ﬁrst, and to do B, I need to do C ﬁrst.

- • introspection Children begin to do this by age 3, do

- well by age 5. The WDC needs it.

THE SPELKE EXPERIMENT- This psychological experiment exhibits abilities of human

- babies we want in the WDC.

- Elizabeth Spelke described a number of experiments that

- she and others did to discover and verify innate mental

- abilities. The technique uses the fact that a baby

- look longer at something surprising than at something

- that seems familiar.

- Here’s one that was ﬁrst done in 1973 and was repeated

- by Spelke in 1993 with two months old babies. There

- are experimental babies and control babies and the

- periment has two phases.

- babies are shown nothing. The experimental babies

In the ﬁrst phase the control- an object go behind a screen and shortly another object

- emerges on the other side of the screen. The timing

- such as would be appropriate if the ﬁrst object struck

- the second object and knocked it from behind the screen.

- The babies are shown the phenomenon enough times

- get bored with it and stop paying attention.

- In the second phase of the experiment the screen is

- moved. There are two variants. In the ﬁrst variant,

- ﬁrst object strikes the second and knocks it onward.

- the second variant the ﬁrst object stops short of the sec-

- ond, but the second object takes oﬀ as though it had

- been struck. The control babies look at both variants

- the same amount of time. The experimental babies lo

- longer at the second variant.

- The conclusion is that the experimental babies inferred

- that the ﬁrst object had struck the second when the event

- occurred behind the screen. When the screen was

- moved, they were not surprised when the expected event

- was shown to occur but were surprised and looked longer

- when this expectation was not met.

- The conclusion is that babies have innate expectations

- about dynamics. For details see Spelke’s 1994 article

- Cognition, Initial knowlege: six suggestions.

THE WELL-DESIGNED CHILD AS A LOGICALROBOT

- • Not even a sketch of a design—just some ideas.

- • Appearance and reality

- Appears(appearance, object) is too simple except in a lim-

- ited context, but children think in limited contexts.

- Holds(Appears(person, appearance, object), s) says more

- is suitable for referring to the child from the outside.

CONTEXTS

- • The correctness of a child’s beliefs and references

- objects depends on context. Children change context

- frequently.

- • When looking at a child’s ideas from the outside,

- can use the theory of contexts as objects introduced

- my Notes on formalizing context. In that theory Ist(c, p

- true if the proposition p holds in the context c. V alue(c,

- is the value of the expression exp, e.g. Color(Block1),

- context c.

- • V alue(Belief s(Child1, S0), Color(Block1)) = Red asserts

- that in the context of Child1’s beliefs in situation s, Blo

- is red. The context theory lets us enter the context

- Belief s(Child1, S0). Then we have Color(Block1) = R

THREE CHALLENGES AND A CONCLUSION- • Make a robot baby that can do the Spelke experiment

- honestly. But what’s honestly? It may start knowing

- about collisions and knowing about occluded objects,

- at least it shouldn’t start with knowledge combining

- two.

- • Its contexts should change like those of a baby.

- • It should properly relate 2-d appearances to 3-d realit

- and also relate tactile appearances to reality. Here’s

- puzzle.

- • What babies know presents challenges to AI—to AI

- all schools.
