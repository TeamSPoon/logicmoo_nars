International Institute for Nuclear Explosions

John McCarthy

May 15,1996 to April 8, 2004

Nuclear explosions have potential practical and scientiﬁc uses. It is super-

stition to ban them, but making sure they don’t contribute to the possibility of

nuclear war is necessary.

Our idea is that nuclear explosions should be studied and when appropri-

ate carried out mainly by an international institute according to the following

principles.

1. The institute is open to people from all countries.

2. No information is kept secret.

3. All work is to be done safely.

4. Explosions are done when authorized by procedures established by an

internationally representative review board.

5. No weapons are to be designed or tested. Weapon design information is

not to be present.

6. Non-proliferation of weapons is to be advanced.

7. If weapon information is needed for international arms control purposes,

this information should be handled by a diﬀerent organization.

8. I leave open the question of whether the Institute should have an initial

monopoly on nuclear explosions. Large scale practical applications, e.g.

to energy generation, probably preclude monopoly.

Up to now, non-proliferation has been promoted by secrecy as well as by

diplomacy. Secrecy is now almost irrelevant to non-proliferation, because the

essential knowledge required for weapons is widespread. Diplomacy, inspection

and perhaps some coercion have to be relied upon.

There is a signiﬁcant development gap between nuclear explosions and actual

weapons that can be delivered by airplanes or missiles.

What scientiﬁc and practical uses of nuclear explosions may develop is hard

to predict. While both the U.S. and the Soviet Union did some work in this

direction, the work was always subordinated to the development of weapons.

Here are some possibilities.

1. Earth moving. The Soviets did some work in this direction, and the Amer-

done.

3. The Orion rockets propelled by nuclear explosions. This kind of rocket

can only be used away from the earth’s atmosphere. However, it makes

possible manned missions to the outer planets in reasonable times.

It

didn’t get past the design stage.

4. Nuclear pumped lasers. The American study of this was dominated by the

development of anti-missile weapons which made the task very diﬃcult.

The extremely intense lasers that nuclear explosions make possible may

have interesting scientiﬁc and practical applications.

5. Study of the behavior of matter under the conditions of extreme temper-

atures and pressures.

6. Thermonuclear explosions in underground chambers as a source of energy

for electricity. This will surely work even if other approaches to thermonu-

clear energy continue to prove elusive.

7. Providing for the low probability event of suddenly needing nuclear ex-

plosions for deﬂecting anasteroid to prevent it from hitting the earth. A

New Yorker cartoon showed two dinosaurs. One said, “All I’m saying is

now is the time to develop the technology to deﬂect an asteroid.” As the

dinosaur said, now is the time to develop the technology.

Maybe the establishment of such an institute is politically impossible at

present, because of the great opposition to nuclear explosions for any purpose.

However, as memories of the Cold War with its fears of nuclear war recede, a new

generation (and maybe older generations) will look at the question more calmly.

If this institute is created, it may take some time for worthwhile experiments to

be proposed and agreed upon.

Very likely, there will remain some national programs involving nuclear ex-

plosions.

It will augur ill for the future of humanity if a branch of science and its

associated technology are abandoned permanently for symbolic reasons.

merely banned bomb tests.

The treaty does not make nuclear war less likely. It merely creates an un-

stable situation—favoring the kind of society that can keep secret (or at least

uncertain) that it is carrying out secret weapons projects.
